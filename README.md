# Robotic-Snake
### Overview
This project showcases the development of a modular robotic snake capable of navigating confined and complex environments. The robotic snake leverages advanced motion control, precision articulation, and real-time feedback systems to perform tasks such as pipeline inspections, search-and-rescue missions, and hazardous material exploration.

### Features
Modular design with lightweight 3D-printed components.
Precise articulation using high-torque servo motors (e.g., MG996R).
Real-time motion control and feedback using Arduino microcontrollers and IMU sensors.
Locomotion algorithms programmed in Python, integrated with ROS for real-time operation.
Efficient actuation of multiple joints via PCA9685 servo drivers.

### Components
Microcontroller: Arduino (or compatible).
Actuators: MG996R high-torque servo motors.
Sensors: IMU for orientation feedback.
Driver: PCA9685 servo driver for motor control.
Structure: Lightweight, durable 3D-printed joints.

### Software
Programming Language: Python
Framework: ROS (Robot Operating System)
Libraries:
Adafruit PCA9685 for servo control
